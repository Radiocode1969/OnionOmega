# OnionOmega
Stuff written for the Onion Omega2

This repo contains bits and pieces written for use on the Onion Omega2 and 2+
Developing mostly Python and getting used to the differences with the Raspberry Pi
and PCDuino2.

Experimenting with removing Omega 2 packages to get a minimal system. This is not going very well. 
Will carry on with Omega 2+ for the time being
